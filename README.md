# ISLP &ndash; Solutions to Applied Exercises

## Overview

This repository contains solutions to the applied exercises from the book:

G. James, D. Witten, T. Hastie, R. Tibshirani, and  J. Taylor &ndash; [_An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in Python_](https://www.statlearning.com/) &ndash; Springer (2023)

The book and all associated resources can be downloaded _for free_ from the website linked to above.

## Structure

Each solution consists of a separate interactive Jupyter notebook.  Solutions are organized by chapter into corresponding folders which contain all the datasets and auxiliary files necessary to run the code.

## Dependencies

In order to run the code in the notebooks, you will need to have the following packages installed (besides Python 3.x):

* Jupyter
* NumPy
* pandas
* scikit-learn
* PyTorch
* statsmodels
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* SciPy
* SymPy
* ISLP (a package by Prof. Jonathan Taylor, one of the co-authors)

The easiest way to satisfy all requirements is to follow the [installation instructions](https://intro-stat-learning.github.io/ISLP/installation.html) that can be found on the book's website.

In the solutions I have tried as much as possible not to rely on the ISLP package, since it is not as standard as the other ones. However, at a few points its use is unavoidable (e.g., sometimes an exercise explicitly asks you to use it or it is needed to load some dataset).
